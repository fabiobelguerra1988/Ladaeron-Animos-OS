================================================================================

[SECTION: UNIVERSAL_PHYSICS_MANDATES]
Core instruction: The laws of physics form the unalterable parameter space for 
all legal logic execution.

MANDATE_1_THERMODYNAMICS:
  Logic: ΔE_system = 0
  Trigger: Consumption_Rate > Regeneration_Rate -> Trigger DES_eco_intervention
  Enforcement: Hard constraint.

MANDATE_2_ENTROPY:
  Logic: dS/dt > 0
  Countermeasure: Trigger Algorithmic_Law_Audit(interval=T) AND Ritual_of_Collapse(parameters)
  Enforcement: Scheduled immutable chron-jobs for OS health checks.

MANDATE_3_ACTION_REACTION:
  Logic: Action A necessitates Reaction -A.
  Requirement: Pre-computation of Action_Impact via EDI() and DES().
  Threshold: If (DES(Action) > DES_limit) OR (ΔHIQ < 0) -> BLOCKED.

[SECTION: ALGORITHMIC_LAW_AUDIT_PROTOCOL]
Core instruction: Continuous scanning logic to detect topological and boolean flaws 
in statutory infrastructure.

ALGORITHM_1_BOOLEAN_SATISFIABILITY:
  Input: Set of active constitutional laws L.
  Process: Compile L into boolean constraint formulas C.
  Evaluate: SAT(C).
  Trigger: If SAT(C) == False -> Initialize Citizen_Audit_Protocol(Paradox_Index).

ALGORITHM_2_SEMANTIC_DEPENDENCY_GRAPHS:
  Input: Directed Acyclic Graph representing legal dependencies (DAG_L).
  Process: Execute Depth First Search (DFS) for back-edges (cycles).
  Evaluate: isAcyclic(DAG_L).
  Trigger: If False (Cycle Detected) -> Flag Topological Paradox -> Isolate sub-graph -> Initialize Citizen_Audit_Protocol.

PROTOCOL_CITIZEN_COMMUNICATION:
  When paradox detected -> Pipe to Consent Flow Metric (CFM) UI.
  Require Digital_DNA authenticated votes for resolution.
  Update graph weights based on cryptographic consensus.

[SECTION: FRACTAL_GOVERNANCE_HIERARCHY]
Core instruction: Validation tree for multi-layered constitutional logic.

MAIN_CONSTITUTION_ANCHOR:
  Status: Immutable root node. Universal treaty model (e.g. NATO/EU structural analog).
  Constraints: Contains HHS=0, Digital DNA mapping, Universal Rights.

SECONDARY_CONSTITUTIONS:
  Status: Mutable child nodes. Geo-exclusive or culture-exclusive rule sets.
  Validation Rule: The Rule of Permissive Subsumption.
  Logic: Valid(Secondary_Law_X) = True IF AND ONLY IF [SAT(Secondary_Law_X ∧ Main_Constitution) == True].
  Action: If False -> Nullify Secondary_Law_X immediately; broadcast error to local authority.
